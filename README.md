ORGANICA-AI
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

ORGANICA-AI is an AI-powered health diagnostics platform that unifies multiple screening modules into a single application. It leverages FastAPI (backend) and React + Tailwind (frontend) for a modern, scalable, and professional setup.

The platform provides users with:

Heart Screening (based on heartbeat values).

Blood Report Analysis (hemoglobin & sugar levels).

Cancer Risk Detection (basic tumor marker analysis).

Future Risk Prediction (age, lifestyle, family history).

User Authentication (Signup & Login with session support).

Personalized Dashboard (all reports in one place).

Downloadable PDF Reports (friendly summaries + contributing factors).

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
Frontend

React.js â†’ Modern UI framework.

Tailwind CSS â†’ Utility-first styling for responsive design.
